Hack-a-thing 2 README

Cristina Curcelli and Scott Bohn

DESCRIPTION:

We created a chrome extension that grabs the first five links from a web page, then prompts the user if they want to open them.
We initially followed google's basic extension tutorial found here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted
We then followed a follow up tutorial regarding opening tabs and messaging here: https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-make-a-chrome-extension
After that, we added functionality to dig up multiple web pages and open them at once.

WHO DID WHAT:

Cristina did the initial coding via the tutorial, and added some extra messaging components. Cristina also did the initial coding to parse 
web links from a page. Scott added the for loops to dig up multiple web linksand display the pop up confirmation box. Scott also added the 
opening of multiple tabs at once from the previously gathered links.


WHAT WE LEARNED:

We learned how to create a chrome extension, and how APIs and messaging worked in that context. We also brushed up on javascript skills.


WHAT DIDN'T WORK:

We could not get the popup to create clickable links to pick and choose which links to open, which was our original intention.
